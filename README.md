# NumberSets
## Overview
NumberSets is a puzzle game where players fill a 9x9 board, ensuring that each compartment (separated by black cells) contains a complete numerical set. The challenge lies in respecting placement rules while avoiding number repetition in rows and columns.

 ### Rules

1) Each white compartment must contain a consecutive set of numbers in any order.  
2) No number can repeat in any row or column.  
3) Black squares may contain numbers that serve as clues, eliminating those numbers from their respective row and column.
